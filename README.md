# Forge-Node: Project 2 - Data Visualization
Prison Data on Jupyter

Project Goals:
1. Come up with questions about the data: What trends exist? Does that contradict what we'd expect? What are some key takeaways we can pull from the data?
2. Explore your data! Try statistics and numerical insights, and build visualizations that describe the trends you see
3. Document your code! Use comments, markdown cells, anything to make a self-supported analysis of the data and the outcome
